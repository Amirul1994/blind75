You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target. 
Your task is to find two distinct indices i and j such that the sum of nums[i] and nums[j] is equal to the target. 
You can assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

lst = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3]

target = 7

for i in range (len(lst)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] + lst[j] == target:
            print(f"indices are {[i, j]}")
            print(f"numbers are {[lst[i], lst[j]]}")
